Cookie Clicker is one of the most well-known idle games ever created. Developed by Julien Thiennot, it is an addictive incremental game where your primary task is to click on a giant cookie on the screen to produce more cookies. With every click, you earn a certain amount of cookies, which can be used to purchase upgrades like automatic clickers, grandmas, and factories that generate cookies for you, even when you’re not actively playing.

As the game progresses, it becomes more complex with achievements to unlock, milestones to reach, and a variety of upgrades that keep the gameplay fresh and engaging. Over time, the number of cookies you produce increases exponentially, making it a game that keeps you coming back to check on your progress.

<h2>Why is Cookie Clicker Blocked?</h2>
